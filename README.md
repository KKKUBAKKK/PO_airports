This is a project I did during my second year at the univeristy, for Object Oriented Design course.
It's basically a flight tracker. The map and API to interact with it were provided to us.
Every 2 weeks we were given new tasks and were graded on the previous ones.
The main goal was to use the right design patterns and make the code easily adjustable, as we didn't know
what the next task is going to be.
